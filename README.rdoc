== Adding user after login with Devise

Devise with default configuration don't allow to adding a new user after you are log in. 

So, you need to make a new file in app/controllers
    registrations_controller.rb
    
and past content of the same file from this repository.
Controller checks if user is log in and behaves as appropriate.

Addictionaly, you can add or copy a new notice (:adding_user) to config/locales/devise.en.yml
